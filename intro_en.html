<h2>Background information:</h2>
This tool has been developed as part of the Collaborative Research by 
The Movement for Community-led Development. 
For further information on who developed it and how to use it, see this 
<a href=https://mcld.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DRAFT-Guidance-Document-for-CLD-Assessment-Tool.pdf
rel="noreferrer" target=_blank>
    <b>Guidance document</b></a>						
<h2>Glossary:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>CLD - Community-led Development
    <li>M&E - Monitoring and Evaluation</li>
    <li>Accountability Mechanisms - Accountability mechanisms include parties sharing monitoring reports, accounting for their decisions and spending through public notice boards and through interactive sessions such as public forums e.g. social audits or quarterly or bi-annual decentralized workshops where all communities can be represented, etc.,</li>
    <li>Facilitator - the front-line staff who explain the program and work with communities on a day to day basis to facilitate planning and action. Facilitators may work for NGOs, be community volunteers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who should complete this tool and when?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Officers, M&E specialists, and practitioners with an informed understanding of program implementation, outputs and outcomes, whether intended or already measured. This tool may also be completed through a participatory exercise with community leaders and program staff.</li>
    <li>Organizations can use this tool at different program junctures to self-assess how programming aligns with CLD characteristics - during design, mid-program reviews, or at the end of a program cycle to inform future programs.</li>
    <li>Organizations can also use the tool during organizational reviews to understand programming across areas.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Explanation of Sections:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Basic Info: </b>collects basic information on who completed the form, when this took place, and any other descriptors an organization might want for future reference.</li>
    <li><b>Rubric</b> collects information on CLD characteristics and processes</li>
    <li><b>Results</b> Pages summarizing overall, characteristics and processes</li>
    <li><b>Data</b> Options to export, import or delete the data from your local cata.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to complete the rubric?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Each dimension in the rubric includes different statements and possible responses.</li>
    <li>The response options (and their corresponding points) include insufficient information (0), doesn’t try (1), tries (2), progressed (3), and succeeds (4).</li>
    <li>Click the button on which of these responses best describes your organization’s current work and progress on the different CLD characteristics, facilitation, and M&E processes</li>
    <li>The rubric will auto caculate the score for each dimension and display it under results</li>
</ul>
<h2>How can you interpret the results?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A goal for organizations using CLD approaches should be to eventually reach the outer rim for the components relevant to their contexts, programming, and operations.</li>
    <li>Not all dimensions may be relevant to all programs, but where they are, the position on the graph can help organizations see where they can push their programming further.</li>
    <li>Overall Results: reflects the outcomes of all of the rubric’s segments.</li>
    <li>Breakdowns: The rubric includes further break-downs of dimensions A - G (of the CLD characteristics) and processes ( M&E and Facilitation) offering information on how these dimensions might function within a particular organization. These break-downs are included in graph form in  tabs 4 & 5 so that this detail is not lost.
